```{R}
library(ggplot2)
library(gcookbook)
print(simpledat)
barplot(simpledat, beside=TRUE)

#To transpose a matrix- goal is to shift variables along x axis
t(simpledat)
barplot(t(simpledat), beside=TRUE)

#To plot with lines instead of bars
#First we call plot(), which tells R to create a new graph and draw a line for one row of data
plot(simpledat[1,], type="l")

#Then we tell it to draw a second row with lines():
lines(simpledat[2,], type="l", col="blue")
```

#ggplot 2
```{R}
#With ggplot2, the structure of the data is always the same: it requires a data frame in "long" format, 
#as opposed to the "wide" format used previously. When the data is in long format, each row represents one item. 
#Instead of having their groups determined by their positions in the matrix, the items have their groups specified in a separate column. 
#Here is simpledat, converted to long format:

simpledat_long
